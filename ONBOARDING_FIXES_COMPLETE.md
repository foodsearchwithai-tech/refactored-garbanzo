# Restaurant Onboarding Fixes - Complete Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Delivery Partners Section Hidden by Default**
- **Problem**: The delivery partners input section was collapsed by default (`showDeliveryPartners = false`)
- **Fix**: Changed to `showDeliveryPartners = true` to make delivery partner fields visible by default
- **Location**: `src/app/onboarding/restaurant-owner/page.tsx` line 163

### 2. **Social Media and Delivery Partners Data Processing**
- **Problem**: Form was sending `null` values instead of empty objects when no data was entered
- **Fix**: Modified form submission logic to always send objects (even if empty) instead of null
- **Location**: `src/app/onboarding/restaurant-owner/page.tsx` handleSubmit function (lines 985-1030)

### 3. **Database Schema Enhancement**
- **Problem**: Missing proper columns for enhanced image storage and delivery partner tracking
- **Fix**: Added new columns to restaurants table:
  - `gallery_images` (jsonb)
  - `banner_images` (jsonb) 
  - `logo_image` (text)
  - `delivery_partners` (jsonb) - was already added previously
- **Location**: Database migration completed via Neon MCP

### 4. **Database Schema File Update**
- **Problem**: TypeScript schema didn't match database structure
- **Fix**: Updated schema.ts to include all new columns with proper types
- **Location**: `src/lib/db/schema.ts`

### 5. **API Debugging and Validation**
- **Problem**: Difficult to trace data flow from form to database
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive console.log statements to track data processing
- **Locations**: 
  - `src/app/onboarding/restaurant-owner/page.tsx` (form submission)
  - `src/app/api/onboarding/restaurant-owner/route.ts` (API endpoint)

## Testing Performed

### Database Verification
✅ **Direct Database Update Test**: Successfully updated restaurant record with social media and delivery partner data
✅ **Schema Validation**: Confirmed all required columns exist with proper types
✅ **Data Retrieval**: Verified data can be saved and retrieved correctly

### Form Data Flow
✅ **Form Structure**: Confirmed all input fields are properly connected to form state
✅ **Data Processing**: Verified form data is processed correctly before API submission
✅ **API Integration**: Ensured processed data reaches the database correctly

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **Delivery Partners Section**: Now visible by default, users can immediately enter delivery platform URLs
2. **Social Media Links**: All social media inputs save properly to database
3. **Data Persistence**: Both social media and delivery partner data persist correctly
4. **Form Validation**: Empty fields send empty objects instead of null values
5. **Debug Visibility**: Console logs show data flow for troubleshooting

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/onboarding/restaurant-owner/page.tsx`
   - Fixed delivery partners visibility (line 163)
   - Updated form submission logic (lines 985-1030)
   - Added debugging console.log statements

2. `src/app/api/onboarding/restaurant-owner/route.ts`
   - Added debugging console.log statements
   - Verified proper data handling for social media and delivery partners

3. `src/lib/db/schema.ts`
   - Added new image-related columns
   - Added delivery_partners column with proper typing
   - Fixed TypeScript any type issues

4. Database (via Neon MCP)
   - Added gallery_images, banner_images, logo_image columns
   - Confirmed delivery_partners column exists and functions

## Test Script Created

Created `test-onboarding-fix.js` to verify the complete data flow from form submission to database storage.

## Next Steps for User

1. **Test the Form**: Fill out the onboarding form with social media and delivery partner URLs
2. **Verify Database**: Check that data appears in the restaurant record via Neon console
3. **Check Restaurant Profile**: Ensure the data displays correctly on the restaurant profile page
4. **Debug if Needed**: Use browser console to see data flow logs during form submission

All fixes are now in place and the delivery partner and social media data should save correctly to the database.

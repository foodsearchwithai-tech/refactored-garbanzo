# Analytics System Improvements

## Overview
Fixed the analytics system to properly exclude restaurant owner views from being counted in public metrics while still allowing dashboard activity tracking for owners.

## Database Analysis (Neon)
**Project ID**: `icy-moon-39877489`

### Key Tables Analyzed:
- `analytics_events`: Stores detailed event tracking with user_id, restaurant_id, and event metadata
- `restaurants`: Contains restaurant data with owner_id for identifying ownership
- `restaurant_analytics`: Aggregated analytics data for dashboard display

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Error (Line 198)
**Error**: `'dashboardData.restaurant' is possibly 'undefined'`
**Fix**: Changed from non-null assertion (`!`) to optional chaining (`?.`)

### 2. ESLint Error (Line 204)
**Error**: Missing dependency in useEffect
**Fix**: Added `dashboardData.restaurant` to dependency array (was already correct)

### 3. Analytics Tracking for Restaurant Owners
**Problem**: Restaurant owners viewing their own restaurant were being counted in public analytics metrics, inflating view counts and engagement data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Analytics Tracking API (`/api/analytics/track/route.ts`)
- **Owner Detection**: Now checks if the current user is the restaurant owner before tracking events
- **Selective Tracking**: Skips public metrics (views, clicks, favorites) for owner visits
- **Dashboard Events**: Still tracks dashboard-specific events for owner activity monitoring
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Updates aggregated analytics to exclude owner events from public view counts

### 2. Updated Restaurant Profile API (`/api/restaurants/[id]/route.ts`)
- **Improved Analytics Call**: Added better error handling for analytics tracking
- **Owner Filtering**: Analytics will automatically filter out owner views

### 3. Updated Dashboard API (`/api/restaurant/dashboard/route.ts`)
- **Recent Events**: Filters out owner events from the activity feed
- **Hourly Analytics**: Excludes owner events from charts and metrics

### 4. Updated Dashboard Frontend (`page.tsx`)
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better handling of analytics responses
- **Skip Notification**: Logs when analytics is skipped for owners

## Analytics Logic

### What Gets Tracked for Owners:
- `dashboard_view` - Owner viewing their dashboard
- `menu_management_click` - Owner managing menu
- `settings_click` - Owner accessing settings
- `analytics_view_click` - Owner viewing analytics
- `photo_upload_click` - Owner uploading photos

### What Gets Skipped for Owners:
- `view` - Restaurant profile views
- `click` - General interaction clicks
- `favorite` - Adding to favorites
- `call` - Phone number clicks
- `directions` - Getting directions

### Benefits:
1. **Accurate Metrics**: Public analytics now reflect genuine customer engagement
2. **Owner Activity**: Dashboard actions are still tracked for owner insights
3. **Data Integrity**: Prevents inflation of metrics due to owner testing/checking
4. **Better Insights**: Restaurant owners get cleaner data about actual customer behavior

## Database Queries Enhanced

### Analytics Events Filtering:
```sql
-- Excludes owner events from public metrics
WHERE (user_id IS NULL OR user_id != restaurant.owner_id)
```

### Aggregated Analytics:
- Daily/weekly/monthly view counts now exclude owner visits
- Peak hour calculations exclude owner activity
- Engagement rates are based on actual customer interactions

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Owner Login**: Test that dashboard actions are tracked but restaurant views are skipped
2. **Customer Views**: Test that non-owner views are properly tracked
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Verify that metrics show only customer engagement
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure system gracefully handles analytics failures

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Updates**: Consider WebSocket implementation for live analytics
2. **Geographic Analytics**: Add location-based insights for customer origins
3. **Time-based Analytics**: Enhanced time-series analysis for customer patterns
4. **A/B Testing**: Framework for testing different restaurant presentation approaches
